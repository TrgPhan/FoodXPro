## Usage

### Run the Backend

Follow these steps to get the backend server running:

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create and activate a new Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Uncomment the `init_db_chroma` function call in `main.py` if this is your first time running the application to initialize the database.
5.  Start the server using Uvicorn:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    This will start the backend server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
